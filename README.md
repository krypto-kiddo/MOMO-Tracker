# MOMO-Tracker

An ERC20 token I  launched on Ropsten Network that can be tracked using this nice userfriendly tracker dashboard.

Techs used:
Solidity, HTML, CSS, Javascript, REST API, My soggy brain that's tired in the middle of the day.

MOMO is an ERC20 token which I deployed on to ropsten, It was coded to make its transfers easily trackable. I've used the etherscan api for retrieving transfer data of the token.
I named the toke "2x Veg Steamed Momos Parcelled" because i was too lazy for any more creative names for my tokens so I just named it on what I had last time for dinner.

Users can track token transfers on this page as shown below

I'd like to thank Questbook for inspiring me to make an ERC20 token tracker. Ofcourse its very different from what they expected (They wanted to use Infuria API and MongoDB on local machine to store transactions and then show it on a web page) , But then since Etherscan already does the stuff why waste resources on storage and tracking again. 

Do read the coin contract.
